# LSI Engine

This repository contains the implementation of a Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) engine as part of an academic project for the **Information Retrieval** class at the **University of California, Irvine (UCI)**. The project was created to explore and implement the principles of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for information retrieval and document clustering.

## Overview

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a powerful technique for extracting and representing the meaning of words in a corpus. By applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to the term-document matrix, LSA reduces the dimensions of the data, uncovering relationships between terms that are not explicitly stated. This technique is widely used in information retrieval, text mining, and natural language processing tasks.

### Key Features:
- **LSA Implementation**: A basic implementation of LSA to showcase how it can be used to cluster documents based on semantic meaning.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: The core mathematical technique used to reduce the dimensions of the term-document matrix.

## Privacy and Removal of Content

Since this project was part of an academic course at UCI, certain parts of the original repository have been removed or modified to ensure that sensitive information from the UCI ICS subdomain is not exposed or indexed. The following actions were taken to maintain privacy and ensure compliance with academic and institutional guidelines:

- **Sensitive Data Removal**: Any links, references, or data related to the UCI ICS subdomain were removed to prevent unauthorized crawling and indexing.
- **Non-Indexing Measures**: The repository has been edited to avoid any automated searches or crawls of UCI-related content.

What remains in the repository are the **highlights of the LSA implementation**, which are useful for understanding how LSA works in the context of information retrieval.
